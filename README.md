### VirtualWorlds
Repository for Assignment 2

### **Purpose** 
The purpose of the beach club is to allow an escape for those looking for one. With virtual reality changing users’ experiences wherever they are my world can provide an upbeat atmosphere to enhance the users mood, while also providing tranquillity through the familiarisation of the connotations that come with beach settings such as calm, relaxing and a safe place. I wanted to re create a safe space where people can escape to but also add a modern and more uplifting element to it by making it a beach club with a DJ and music. The inspiration came from thoughts of happiness on holiday, my world will give users who often long and wish for a holiday at any time of the year the chance to replicate that through the use of virtual reality worlds, this is an opportunity of a free escape or mini break for a user.
